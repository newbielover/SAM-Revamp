        <h3>	Why Is Shapiro Asset Different than other Registered Advisors?</h3>
        <p>
         Unlike most financial advisors, I have over 35 years experience managing portfolios, much of which was institutional with assets in the hundreds of million dollars.   Your assets are not directed to the latest hot mutual fund or annuity that the typical investment advisor is compensated to do or encouraged by his portfolio strategist. Additionally, since we typically don't use mutual funds, we are able to directly minimize your capital gains tax and the expenses of managing the account.  Because you directly own the securites within your account you have the option to specify investment restrictions in your account. We invest our monies side by side with our clients, and view them as partners in our investment strategies. SAM emphasizes client service.
