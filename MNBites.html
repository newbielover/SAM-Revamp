 <h3 class="equity">Trump’s Policies Could Boost Economy and Corporate Profits</h3>
      <p class="intro">
				The stock market seems to really like Donald Trump. Despite widespread prediction that equities would
tank if the maverick billionaire scored an historic upset, 
Americans’ 401(k) plans have prospered since Election Day. Setting aside fears of trade wars, Wall Street has embraced the idea that a President Trump opens at least the possibility of a breakthrough that seemed a total long-shot before: An era of far faster growth than the tepid expansion America’s experienced in recent years. The President-elect has proposed a series of controversial, but highly ambitious proposals for super-charging the economy. If they work, Americans’ portfolios could flower.

    <h3 class="equity">Trump Win a Windfall for Stock Market’s Little Guys</h3>
      <p class="intro">
			The rally following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory has already trickled down to Wall Street’s so-called little guys, with retail investors storming back to the bullish camp and small-capitalization stocks headed toward the longest win streak in over a decade. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization companies surged to see its best performance since the index’s inception in July 1987. Small-cap stocks tend to be less liquid than large caps, so are seen as more risky. Therefore, many market watchers view Russell 2000 outperformance as bullish for the broader stock market, because it suggests investors have become more risk acceptant, and open to buying stocks of all sizes.

    <h3 class="equity">Wall Street Doesn’t Fear President Trump</h3>
      <p class="intro">
				Shares of many banks, drugmakers, oil companies and construction firms all rallied sharply following Trump’s victory.  Investors now seem to be betting that Trump, combined with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, may look to unwind some of the regulations on financial services companies put into place during the Obama administration. There are also hopes that Trump will propose plans to boost infrastructure spending, drill more for oil and also push back on some of the attacks against drug and biotech companies for price hikes on key medications. But there are still questions about who Trump may appoint to slots on the Federal Reserve over his term. That will impact the markets. Who Trump may choose to add to the Supreme Court could also have an effect on stocks.  Tough talk from Trump about Mexico and China have also raised some worries that he could start a trade war which could be damaging to the markets, jobs and overall economy.
